# Iteration 1 verification

Measured locally on 2026-09-08 with Python 3.14.3.

Command: `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`

Result: **12 tests passed, 0 failures, 0 errors** (0.017 seconds reported by unittest).

The seven scripted demo events produced:

| Autonomy | Events |
|---|---:|
| Silent | 2 |
| Notify | 2 |
| Ask | 2 |
| Escalate | 1 |

Initial effects: two labels and one draft created, zero messages sent, zero emails archived. The CLI approval flow was also run against a persistent database: approving the pending send changed its status to `executed` in the local simulation.

These are execution/policy checks, **not measured AI accuracy, learning performance, or prompt-injection detection results**. The proposer is scripted, and no real messages were delivered. Full evaluation remains to be implemented.

Environment issue found during verification: one shell resolved `python3` to Python 3.6. The successful checks explicitly used the installed Python 3.14 interpreter. The application now exits with a clear Python 3.11+ requirement when invoked with an older interpreter.
